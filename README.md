## Refactoring is an important part of coding without which maintaining a software will be a nightmare. 
Here are some refactoring patterns that apply 
<ul>
<li>Basic principles </li>
    <li> Design patterns</li>
    <li> Common sense</li>

<h2> Please go to a concept first. Then all the codes are wrapped in package before and after.</h2> 
Check the problem in package "before" before refactoring and moving to solution on "after" after refactoring.
